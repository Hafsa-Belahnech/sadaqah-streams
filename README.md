# Sadaqah Streams
Connected Solidarity &amp; Smart Resilience for Flood-Affected Cities — Ramadania Hackathon 2026

> **Connected Solidarity & Resilience for Our Cities**  
> Ramadania Hackathon 2026 Submission

## 🌧️ The Problem
Lately cities had faced devastating floods that displaced families and destroyed infrastructure. Traditional charity helps in the moment but doesn’t prevent future disasters.

## 💡 Our Solution
A digital platform that lets citizens give **Sadaqah** to:
- Provide **immediate relief** (food, water, shelter)
- Fund **smart resilience projects** (rain gardens, retention basins, solar pumps)
- Assisting citizens and municipalities in anticipating flood risks ahead of heavy rainfall.

## ✨ Key Innovation: Sadaqah Streams Score™
Every donor sees their real impact:
> “Your Sadaqah secured **800L of clean water** and gave **50** blankets and other clothes!”

## 📄 Presentation
See our full pitch: [presentation.pdf](presentation.pdf)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Concept)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (demo only)
- Future: Mobile app, geolocation alerts, city dashboard

## 🤖 AI-Powered Flood Risk Predictor (Demo Concept)
- **Goal**: Help citizens and municipalities anticipate flood risk *before* heavy rain.
- **How?** A lightweight AI model (pre-trained, no training needed) that uses:
  - Public weather forecasts (e.g., from OpenWeather API)
  - Historical flood data (open datasets, e.g., from national meteorological agencies)
  - Real-time street-level elevation & drainage info (from OpenStreetMap)
- **Tech for Demo**:
  - Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS → displays a **"Flood Risk Score"** for the user’s neighborhood (e.g., "Low", "Medium", "High")
  - Backend (simulated): A static JSON file (`risk-data.json`) with mock predictions per zone (e.g., `{ "zone_id": "ALG-CENTRE", "risk": "high", "confidence": 0.82 }`)
